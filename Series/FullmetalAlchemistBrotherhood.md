# Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood

> **Edward Elric:** Who are you? 
**Truth:** Oh I am so glad you ask! I am called by many names: I'm the World, I'm the Universe, I'm God, I'm Truth, I'm all, I'm one, and I'm also... you. You have dared to knock on the door, now... the door is open.

> **Riza Hawkeye:** The heroes during times of war are nothing but mass murderers during times of peace

---

> **Maes Hughes:** When I return home, I will swallow every horrible thing I have done here, and I will smile when I’m with her

---

> **Van Hohenheim:** I thought living forever was nothing but exhausting. But since I met you and our sons, for the first time I felt glad to be alive. It was a full life

---

> **Roy Mustang:** The world isn’t perfect. But it’s there for us, doing the best it can…that’s what makes it so damn beautiful

---

> **Izumi Curtis:** All is one, one is all

---

> **Olivier Armstrong:** Love for the dead is pointless. We fight to keep them alive, that is all

---

> **Edward Elric:** Equivalent exchange. I’ll give you half of my life so give me half of yours!
