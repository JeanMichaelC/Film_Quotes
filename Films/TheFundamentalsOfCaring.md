# The Fundamentals of Caring

> **Caregiving Instructor** *Caregiving is not just about feeding and clothing and cleaning. It is also about understanding how to navigate a complicated relationship between those who give care, and those who are in need of it. If you find yourself lost, frustrated, confused, you can always come back to this helpful mnemonic device: ALOHA. Ask, Listen, Observe, Help, Ask again*

> **Trevor:** I'd really like to take a pee standing up.
**Ben:** [nods] Yeah, it's pretty awesome. 
[Trevor laughs]

> **Dot:** I told you I only date assholes.
**Trevor:** Yes, and I'm not an asshole. And since you want an asshole, my not being an asshole makes me more of an asshole than the assholes that you normally date, because they're giving you exactly what you want, whereas I, by not being an asshole, am not. Which makes me an asshole.
**Dot:** I can't believe I actually understood that.

> **Ben:** Well, take care of yourself in Denver. There are a lot of perverts there.
**Dot:** Yeah? And how would you know?
**Ben:** We all keep in touch.[boht laugh and hug]

> **Ben:** [typing his book]  Soon after our trip, I resigned as his caregiver, but continued on as his friend. Two weeks ago, when I went to visit Trevor on his 21st birthday, I found him lying on the floor of his bedroom, finally at peace. The new caregiver, a kind woman in her 60s named Anna, was sobbing. She, like me, knew just how special he was. He was faking, of course. Anna quit the next day.
