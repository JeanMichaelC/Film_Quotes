# The Last Samurai

> **Nathan:** 1876. Day unknown. Month unknown... They are an intriguing people.  From the moment they wake… they devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue. I have never seen such discipline.
I am surprised to learn that the word “Samurai” means “to serve” …and that Katsumoto believes his rebellion to be in the service of the Emperor.

> **Nobutada:** Please forgive. Too many mind. 
**Nathan:** Too many mind?
**Nobutada:** Hi! Mind sword, mind people watch, mind enemy. Too many mind… No mind. 
**Nathan:** No mind…

> **Nathan:** Winter, 1877. What does it mean to be Samurai?  To devote yourself utterly to a set of moral principles… to seek stillness of your mind… and to master the way of the sword.

> **Nathan:** Spring 1877. This marks the longest I have stayed in one place since I left the farm at 17. There is so much here that I'll never understand. I have never been a church-going man, and what I’ve seen on the field of battle… had led me to question God’s purpose. But there is, indeed, something… spiritual in this place. And though it may forever be obscure to me… I cannot but be aware of its power. I do know it is here that I have known my first untroubled sleep in many years.

> **Katsumoto:** The perfect blossom is a rare thing. You could spend your life looking for one, and it would not be a wasted life.

---

> **Katsumoto:** You have nightmares? 
**Nathan:** Every soldier has nightmares. 
**Katsumoto:** Only one who is ashamed of what he has done. 
**Nathan:** You have no idea what I have done. 
**Katsumoto:** You have seen many things... 
**Nathan:** I have.
**Katsumoto:** And you do not fear death, but sometimes you wish for it. Is this not so? 
**Nathan:** Yes. 
**Katsumoto:** I, also. It happens to men who have seen what we have seen. And then I come to this place of my ancestors… and I remember. Like these blossoms… we are all dying. To know life in every breath… every cup of tea… every life we take. The way of the warrior... 
**Nathan:** Life in every breath... 
**Katsumoto:** That is Bushido.

> **Katsumoto:** When I took this, you were my enemy. 

---

> **Katsumoto:** You believe… a man can change his destiny?
**Nathan:** I think a man does what he can… until his destiny is revealed to him. 

---

> **Nathan:** May 25th 1877. This will be the last entry in this journal. I’ve tried to give a true accounting of what I have seen, what I have done. I do not presume to understand the couse of my life. I know I am grateful to have partaken of all this… even if for a moment.

> **Simon Graham:** And so the days of the Samurai had ended. Nations, like men, it is sometimes said, have their own destiny. As for the American Captain... no one knows what became of him. Some say that he died of his wounds... Others, that he returned to his own country. But I like to think... he may have at last found some small measure of peace... that we all seek, and few of us ever find.
